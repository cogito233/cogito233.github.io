Hi, here is Zhiheng. Welcome to my personal website. Pleasure to see you.~

Currently I'm a 2nd-year student at the University of Hong Kong majoring in CS. I'm working at METH Zurich as a Research Assistant this summer vacation focusing on causal learning, model interpretability, and national language processing.  All my personal experiments are shown in my [resume](https://cogito233.github.io/cv/). Others of my research interest is ranging from representation learning, adaptive learning, unsupervised learning, and any other approaches to making deep learning models more national and beautiful.

Saussure said that language is the format of thinking, although it is still a controversial argument, the only thing we know is that the national language is still the most powerful way to communicate with "thinking".
