Hi, here is Zhiheng. Welcome to my personal website, nice to see you~

Currently I’m a visiting student at UC Berkeley, and I'm 3th year CS major undergraduate student in the University of Hong Kong, supervised by Lingpeng Kong. This summer, I'll be working at the Berkeley Artificial Intelligence Research (BAIR) Lab, supervised by Kevin Yang, focusing on controllable text generation. Previously, I've worked at the ETH NLPED Lab under the supervision of Zhijing Jin and as a research intern at Megvii R-face institution. My research interests include Controllable Text Generation, Interpretable Learning, and Causal Inference. I'm deeply passionate about developing AI solutions for human benefit – for more details, please see my Statements.

In addition to my research in computer science, statistics, and machine learning, I'm enthusiastic about exploring diverse areas such as philosophy, psychology, sociology, and economics. I believe that knowledge from different fields offers transferable paradigms and that a macro perspective is useful for solving local problems and understanding the "real problem" at hand.

If you're a potential collaborator with similar interests, feel free to email me at `zhihenglyu.cs@gmail.com`. I'm open to discussing my current projects or exploring potential cooperation in any of the following areas:

* Research Project
* Developing Open source project
* Cofounder of Community/Association
* Start-up Companies

For freshmen and sophomores interested in pursuing CS research, please don't hesitate to reach out. I'm excited to meet new people from diverse backgrounds, share my experiences, and potentially start a mentorship.

For my previous experimence, please see my [Resume](https://cogito233.github.io/cv/).

## Some Random Info

"Cogito ergo sum." said Descartes. In his philosophy, "being" is the result of "thinking". I am so deeply aspired by this phrase that, probing how "thinking" happens is the most fantastic work for me., even though the "thinking" inside mankind is always biased and misleading. Saussure said that language is the format of thinking, although it is still a controversial argument, the only thing we know is that the natural language is still the most powerful way to communicate with "thinking".

Thanks to the development of computational techniques, today we are closer to the essence of "thinking" than any historical moment.  What will happen tomorrow? We still don't know. 

I have a dream that one day an Android woke up from some martian outpost, and wrote a story about his dream in the logbook, a story about playing with Electric Sheep, about the old time on the earth...
