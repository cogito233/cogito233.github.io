Hi, here is Zhiheng. Welcome to my personal website, nice to see youðŸ˜†~ I'm currently seeking a PhD position on the term of 24Fall. My research interests are specifically focused on `structural text planning and generation`, `causality in natural language processing`, and `the development of efficient large language models (LLMs)`. I am deeply passionate about advancing the field of AI by creating innovative systems that *merge language structures with logical reasoning to address complex real-world problems efficiently*. â€“ for more details, please see my [SoP](https://cogito233.github.io/files/SoP_v3.pdf) and [CV](https://cogito233.github.io/files/CV.pdf).

Currently I'm a senior undergraduate student major in Computer Science in University of Hong Kong, supervised by Lingpeng Kong. Last summer, I work at the [Berkeley NLP](https://nlp.cs.berkeley.edu/), supervised by [Kevin Yang](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~yangk/) and Prof [Dan Klein](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~klein/), focusing on fact tracking and contradict detection in a narrative structure, such as story outline. Previously, I've worked at the [ETH NLPED Lab](https://www.mrinmaya.io/) under the supervision of [Zhijing Jin](https://zhijing-jin.com/fantasy/) and [Dr. Mrinmaya Sachan](https://inf.ethz.ch/people/person-detail.MjYyNzc4.TGlzdC8zMDQsLTg3NDc3NjI0MQ==.html), and as a research intern at [Megvii](https://en.megvii.com/). 

## Research Highlight

- Fact tracking and contradict detection in story outline
- Probing the Understanding of Large Language Model in Causality
- Explore new Training Paradigm for a Causal Graph based on Conditional Independent Test
- Construct and Pre-process Datasets on NLP for Social Good
