Hi, here is Zhiheng. Welcome to my personal website, nice to see you~ I'm currently seeking a PhD position on the term of 24 Fall, mainly forcus on developing module of systems that merge data, symbolic reasoning, and NLP.

Currently I'm senior undergraduate student undergraduate student major in Computer Science in University of Hong Kong, supervised by Lingpeng Kong. Last summer, I work at the Berkeley Artificial Intelligence Research (BAIR) Lab, supervised by Kevin Yang, focusing on fact tracking and contradict detection in a narrative structure, such as story outline. Previously, I've worked at the ETH NLPED Lab under the supervision of Zhijing Jin and as a research intern at Megvii R-face institution. My research interests include Controllable Text Generation, Interpretable, and Causal Inference. I'm deeply passionate about developing AI solutions for human benefit â€“ for more details, please see my [SoP](https://cogito233.github.io/files/SoP_v3.pdf) and [CV](https://cogito233.github.io/files/CV.pdf).

Algorithm competitions are my ex-girlfriend. I enjoy the process of formalizing problems and solving them using abstract symbolic languages. During my time leading the University of Hong Kong's ICPC team, we entered the ICPC World Finals for the first time in 9 years and achieved 9th place in the ICPC World Challenge. We won two gold medals in regional competitions in Shanghai and Nanjing. In high school, I won a silver medal in NOI 2017 and a gold medal in APIO 2017. I was admitted early to Shaoxing No. 1 High School due to my talent in algorithm competitions.

In addition to my research in computer science, statistics, and machine learning, I'm enthusiastic about exploring diverse areas such as philosophy, psychology, sociology, and economics. I believe that knowledge from different fields offers transferable paradigms and that a macro perspective is useful for solving local problems and understanding the "real problem" at hand.

If you're a potential collaborator with similar interests, feel free to email me at `zhihenglyu.cs@gmail.com`. I'm open to discussing my current projects or exploring potential cooperation in any of the following areas: `Research Project`, `Developing Open source project`, `Cofounder of Community/Association`, `Start-up Companies`.

For freshmen and sophomores interested in pursuing CS research, please don't hesitate to reach out. I'm excited to meet new people from diverse backgrounds, share my experiences, and potentially start a mentorship.

## Some Random Info

"Cogito ergo sum." said Descartes. In his philosophy, "being" is the result of "thinking". I am so deeply aspired by this phrase that, probing how "thinking" happens is the most fantastic work for me., even though the "thinking" inside mankind is always biased and misleading. Saussure said that language is the format of thinking, although it is still a controversial argument, the only thing we know is that the natural language is still the most powerful way to communicate with "thinking".

Thanks to the development of computational techniques, today we are closer to the essence of "thinking" than any historical moment.  What will happen tomorrow? We still don't know. 

I have a dream that one day an Android woke up from some martian outpost, and wrote a story about his dream in the logbook, a story about playing with Electric Sheep, about the old time on the earth...
