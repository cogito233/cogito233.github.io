Hi, here is Zhiheng. Welcome to my personal website, nice to see you~

Currently Iâ€™m a visiting student at UC Berkeley, and I'm 3th year CS major undergraduate student in the University of Hong Kong, supervised by Lingpeng Kong. In this summer I'll work at Berkeley Artificial Intelligence Research (BAIR) Lab supervised by Kevin Yang, forcusing on controlable text generation. Previously I'm working at ETH NLPED Lab supervised by Zhijing Jin, and I also spend some time work as a research intern in Megvii R-face institution. I'm currently forcusing on Controlable Text Generation;      Interpretable Learning and Causal Inference while I am deeply passionate about develop AI solutions for human benefit, for more details about that, please see Statements.

Despite my research in computer science, statistics and machine learning, I'm also enthusiastic in diverse areas ranging from philosophy, psychology, sociology and economics. I believe that knowledge in different fields has transferable paradigms, and a macro perspective is useful for solving local problems, and help to understand "what is the real problem".

For potential collaborators with similar interest, you can email me at `zhihenglyu.cs@gmail.com` if you are interested in my current project, or seeking potential cooperation in the any of the following term:

* Research Project
* Developing Open source project
* Cofounder of Community/Association
* Start-up Company

For freshman and sophomore who are ambitious to CS research, please do not hesitate to contact me. I'm glad to meet more new people with diversity background, share my experimence and/or start a potential mentorship.

For my previous experimence, please see my [Resume](https://cogito233.github.io/cv/).

## Some Random Info

"Cogito ergo sum." said Descartes. In his philosophy, "being" is the result of "thinking". I am so deeply aspired by this phrase that, probing how "thinking" happens is the most fantastic work for me., even though the "thinking" inside mankind is always biased and misleading. Saussure said that language is the format of thinking, although it is still a controversial argument, the only thing we know is that the natural language is still the most powerful way to communicate with "thinking".

Thanks to the development of computational techniques, today we are closer to the essence of "thinking" than any historical moment.  What will happen tomorrow? We still don't know. 

I have a dream that one day an Android woke up from some martian outpost, and wrote a story about his dream in the logbook, a story about playing with Electric Sheep, about the old time on the earth...
