## Algorithm Competitions

Algorithm competition is my ex-girlfriend. I enjoy the process of formalizing problems and solving them using abstract symbolic languages, which also motivates me to solve more complex problems by language systems.

### University Achievements
During my time leading the University of [Hong Kong's ICPC team](https://i.cs.hku.hk/~provinci/achievements.html), we achieved several milestones:
- **ICPC World Finals 2022**: Entered for the first time in 9 years, ranked 50th globally
- **ICPC World Challenge 2022**: Achieved 9th place
- **Regional Gold Medals**: Won gold in both Shanghai (ranked 20/668) and Nanjing (ranked 7/556) regions
- **Team Leadership**: Served as team captain and trainer for the algorithm competition group

### High School Background
- **NOI 2018**: Silver Medal at National Olympiad in Informatics
- **APIO 2018**: Gold Medal at Asia-Pacific Informatics Olympiad
- **Early Admission**: Admitted to Shaoxing No.1 High School based on algorithmic talent

The competitive programming experience taught me to think systematically about problem decomposition, optimization, and efficient implementationâ€”skills that directly transfer to my current research in AI systems.

## Interdisciplinary Interests

I'm enthusiastic about exploring diverse areas such as *philosophy*, *psychology*, *sociology*, and *economics*. I believe that knowledge from different fields offers transferable paradigms and that a macro perspective is useful for solving local problems and understanding the "real problem" at hand.

This interdisciplinary approach directly influences my research. For instance, my work on **Psychologically-Inspired Causal Prompts** draws from psychology to understand how different cognitive processes affect language model performance. I believe that understanding human cognition and social dynamics is crucial for developing AI systems that are both effective and aligned with human values.

## Business & Investment Experience

I spent a summer interning at [Capital Today Group](http://www.capitaltoday.com/eng/index.html), where I gained invaluable insights into the business side of technology. I'm deeply grateful to Kathy for teaching me about the comprehensive effects of intangible assets, the value of platforms and brands, and how people tend to overestimate technology in the short term while underestimating it in the long term.

I strongly encourage every technical person to learn some business knowledge. If you're interested in internship opportunities at CTG, please feel free to contact me.


## Some Random Info

"Cogito ergo sum." said Descartes. In his philosophy, "being" is the result of "thinking". I am so deeply aspired by this phrase that, probing how "thinking" happens is the most fantastic work for me., even though the "thinking" inside mankind is always biased and misleading. Saussure said that language is the format of thinking, although it is still a controversial argument, the only thing we know is that the natural language is still the most powerful way to communicate with "thinking".

Thanks to the development of computational techniques, today we are closer to the essence of "thinking" than any historical moment.  What will happen tomorrow? We still don't know. 

I have a dream that one day an Android woke up from some martian outpost, and wrote a story about his dream in the logbook, a story about playing with Electric Sheep, about the old time on the earth...
