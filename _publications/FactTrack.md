We propose FactTrack, an algorithm that decomposes complex narratives into atomic facts and models dynamic world states for contradiction detection. This work addresses the challenging problem of inner-plot factual consistency checking and temporal fact tracking in narrative structures like story outlines.

The key innovation is our temporal fact tracking mechanism that maintains a dynamic world state throughout the narrative timeline, enabling detection of contradictions that emerge from the evolving story context.
