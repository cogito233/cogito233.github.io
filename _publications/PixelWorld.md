PixelWorld investigates reasoning mechanisms in vision-language models (VLMs) across modalities by converting textual reasoning data into visual representations. We develop benchmarks and visualizations to analyze attention patterns and interpretability in VLMs when processing pixel-based reasoning tasks.

This work explores how VLMs handle structured reasoning when information is presented visually rather than textually, providing insights into cross-modal reasoning capabilities and limitations.
